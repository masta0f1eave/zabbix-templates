# zabbix-templates
Here some custom templates for zabbix 4.0+

printer_hp_6040 - Template for SNMP monitoring HP Color CM 6040 MFP, maded from Template Net Network Generic Device version: 0.15.
With this template you can gather some metrics like: toner level at each cartridge, free space in image drums (these are used as toner waste bunkers), count of printed pages.
Gathering SNMP alerts for this model is very complicated task (and not well documented), so I've gaved up with this idea.
